        <pre>:
        This tag is used to display preformatted text. Text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font, and whitespace
        (including line breaks) is preserved.
        <code>:
        This tag is used to display a block of code. It typically appears inside a <pre> element to format the code correctly.
        Class Attribute:
        class="python":
        This class attribute suggests that the code block is written in Python. It can be used by syntax highlighting libraries
        (such as Prism.js or Highlight.js) to apply syntax highlighting to the code block.
        Python Code: The Python code inside the <code> block iterates over each character in the string "abc" and prints the
        uppercase version of each character. Specifically, it prints "A", "B", and "C" on separate lines. -->
    <pre><code class="python">
        for character in "abc":
            print(character.upper())  # Prints A, then B, then C

        Java Code:The Java code inside the <code> block defines an array of strings called names and uses a for-each loop to print each
        name in the array. (?)However, there is a syntax error in the for-each loop.(?) -->
